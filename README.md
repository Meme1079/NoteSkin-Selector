# Q&A

### How do I add the my Custom NoteSkins?
Go to Wiki tab (Work in Progress)

### Can I use it in my Mod?
I don't know why you would use this in your mod? especially lua, it's just weird to see it on there and very unfitting tbh. So it's a maybe just credit me if you're using this script.

### Why does it crash when I used other scripts?
Stop using the script and use other script that doesn't interfere the NoteSkin script
